The goal of the study is to identify risk factors for cardivascular disease (CVD) by following the subjects over time. The data set that we will analyze was collected on 4,434 subjects between 1956 and 1968. A description of the data set is available [here](https://biolincc.nhlbi.nih.gov/media/teachingstudies/FHS_Teaching_Longitudinal_Data_Documentation.pdf).\n","\n","You might guess that the observational unit is a subject.
