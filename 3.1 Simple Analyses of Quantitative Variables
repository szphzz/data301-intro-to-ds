you squint at this plot, you will see an orange line at the bottom of the plot. This is supposed to be the density. But why does it appear as a flat line? The y-axis offers a hint. When we made the density plot earlier, the y-axis extended from 0 to about 0.02. Now the y-axis extends all the way to 500. On such a scale, a curve that fluctuates between 0 and 0.02 will appear to be a flat line!\n","\n","The problem is that the histogram and the density are currently on different scales. By default, histograms display counts, while densities display distributions. In other words, densities are normalized so that the total area under the curve is 1. To be able to display a histogram and density on the same graph, we have to normalize the histogram so that the total area of the bars is 1. We can do this by setting the option
