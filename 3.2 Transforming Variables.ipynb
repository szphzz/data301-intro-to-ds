Over 95% of the observations are in a single bin of this histogram. In other words, this variable is extremely _skewed_.\n","\n","One way to improve this histogram is to use more bins. But this does not solve the fundamental problem: we need more resolution at the lower end of the scale and less resolution at the higher end. One way to spread out the values at the lower end of a distribution and to compress the values at the higher end is to take the logarithm (provided that the values are all positive). Log transformations are particularly effective at dealing with data that is skewed to the right.\n","\n","The log function is not built into Python or `pandas`. We have to import the log function from a library called `numpy`, which contains many functions and data structures for numerical computations. In fact, `pandas` is built on top of `numpy`. When we apply `numpy`'s `log` function to a `pandas` `Series`, the function is automatically broadcast over the elements of the `Series`, returning another `Series`.
