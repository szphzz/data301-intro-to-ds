Just because a variable happens to contain numbers does not necessarily make it \"quantitative\". For example, in the Framingham data set, the `SEX` column was coded as 1 for men and 2 for women. However, these numbers are not on any meaningful numerical scale; a woman is not \"twice\" a man.\n","\n","Variables that are not quantitative but take on a limited set of values are called **categorical variables**. For example, the variable `orientation` takes on one of three possible values (gay, straight, or bisexual), so it is a categorical variable. So is the variable `religion`, which takes on a larger, but still limited, set of values. We call each possible value of a categorical variable a \"level\". Levels are usually non-numeric.\n","\n","Some variables do not fit neatly into either classification. For example, the variable `essay1` contains users' answers to the prompt \"What I’m doing with my life\". This variable is obviously not quantitative, but it is not categorical either because every user has a unique answer. In other words, this variable does not take on a limited set of values. We will group such variables into an \"other\" category.\n","\n","Every variable can be classified into one of these three **types**: \n","- quantitative,\n","- categorical, or\n","- other. \n","\n","The type of the variable often dictates how we analyze that variable, as we will see in the next two chapters."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"xZlpl3SVELs4"},"source":["## Selecting Variables\n","\n","Suppose we want to select the `age` column from the `DataFrame` above.
