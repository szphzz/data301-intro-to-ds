Training error is easy to calculate because the true labels are available in the training data. However, training error is not always a good measure of a model's quality, since a model that _overfits_ to the training data may have artificially low training error.\n","\n","Ideally, we would like to evaluate regression models based on their _test error_, which is the error calculated on the test data. The problem with test error is that it is usually impossible to calculate, since the true labels are rarely available in the test data. In this section, we discuss strategies for estimating the test error using only the training data."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"id":"CRHMJ2usr_px","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1653525803570,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":947,"user":{"displayName":"Sophia Chung","userId":"18074224600171182532"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as np\n","\n","# Extract the training data.\n","data_dir = \"https://dlsun.github.io/pods/data/\"\n","bordeaux_df = pd.read_csv(data_dir + \"bordeaux.csv\",\n","                          index_col=\"year\")\n","bordeaux_train = bordeaux_df.loc[:1980].copy()\n","bordeaux_train[\"log(price)\"] = np.log(bordeaux_train[\"price\"])"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"IJ6e741dr_pz"},"source":["## Validation Error\n","\n","To estimate the test error, we split the training data into a _training set_ and a _validation set_.
