In many classification models, the predicted label is obtained by first obtaining the predicted probabilities and then choosing the class with the highest probability. \n","\n","In the case of the breast cancer data set, there are only two classes, so we predict that a breast mass is malignant if the predicted probability of malignancy is $0.5$ or higher. (We predict it is benign otherwise). Instead of using $0.5$ as the threshold, we could cast a wider net for malignancy by lowering the threshold to $0.4$, predicting a breast mass to be malignant as long as the predicted probability is $0.4$ or higher."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"7wh16AkFNItC","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1653706337267,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":273,"user":{"displayName":"Sophia Chung","userId":"18074224600171182532"}},"outputId":"6fc5c4dd-140f-4ba7-ec36-fe3c8976f0e8"},"source":["probas_ = model.predict_proba(X_train)\n","probas_"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["array([[1. , 0. ],\n","       [0.1, 0.9],\n","       [1. , 0. ],\n","       ...,\n","       [0. , 1. ],\n","       [0. , 1. ],\n","       [0. , 1. ]])"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":8}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"uObOFLpPNItG","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1653706338933,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":297,"user":{"displayName":"Sophia Chung","userId":"18074224600171182532"}},"outputId":"7f0b5cc8-388e-4ba2-f1c7-20440c120457"},"source":["y_train_ = (probas_[:, 1] >= 0.4)\n","\n","(precision_score(y_train == 1, y_train_ == 1),\n"," recall_score(y_train == 1, y_train_ == 1))"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["(0.948, 0.9916317991631799)"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":9}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"dClWFj6ONItK"},"source":["We see that recall increases to 99.2% when we cast this wider net, at the expense of precision, which drops to 94.8%."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"dBI2LCckNItQ"},"source":["It is often instructive to calculate the precision and recall for all possible thresholds and then graph the values as a _precision-recall curve_.
