For example, we may only be interested in whether a person on the titanic was a passenger or a crew member. The variable `class` is too detailed. We can create a new variable, `type`, that is derived from the existing variable `class`. Observations with a `class` of \"1st\", \"2nd\", or \"3rd\" get a value of \"passenger\", while observations with a `class` of \"deck crew\", \"engineering crew\", or \"deck crew\" get a value of \"crew\"."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"gsA4gHKhJtaN","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":423},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1649186663367,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":180,"user":{"displayName":"Sophia Chung","userId":"18074224600171182532"}},"outputId":"10ce7505-bed5-4fcf-f657-1ec60641d8be"},"source":["df_titanic[\"type\"] = df_titanic[\"class\"].map({\n","    \"1st\": \"passenger\",\n","    \"2nd\": \"passenger\",\n","    \"3rd\": \"passenger\",\n","    \"victualling crew\": \"crew\",\n","    \"engineering crew\": \"crew\",\n","    \"deck crew\": \"crew\"\n","})\n","\n","df_titanic"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                                name  gender   age             class embarked  \\\n","0                Abbing, Mr. Anthony    male  42.0               3rd        S   \n","1          Abbott, Mr. Eugene Joseph    male  13.0               3rd        S   \n","2        Abbott, Mr. Rossmore Edward    male  16.0               3rd        S   \n","3     Abbott, Mrs. Rhoda Mary 'Rosa'  female  39.0               3rd        S   \n","4        Abelseth, Miss.
