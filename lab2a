Contestants present their idea for a company to a panel of investors (a.k.a. \"sharks\"), who then decide whether or not to invest in that company.  The investors give a certain amount of money in exchange for a percentage stake in the company (\"equity\").

There are 7 regular sharks, not including \"Guest\". Each shark has a column in the data set, labeled by their last name.)\n","- if funded, the amount of money the sharks put in and the percentage equity they got in return\n","\n","To earn full credit on this lab, you should:\n","- use built-in `pandas` methods (like `.sum()` and `.max()`) instead of writing a for loop over a `DataFrame` or `Series`\n","- use the split-apply-combine pattern wherever possible\n","\n","Of course, if you can't think of a vectorized solution, a `for` loop is still better than no solution at all!"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"xWVgjFTV6AD4","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1649972164347,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":788,"user":{"displayName":"Sophia Chung","userId":"18074224600171182532"}}},"source":["import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as np"],"execution_count":1,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"PA8nrH5u6AD7"},"source":["## Question 0.
