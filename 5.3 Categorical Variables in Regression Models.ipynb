But what if all or some of the features are categorical? In theory, the solution is simple: we simply transform the categorical variables into quantitative variables using dummy (i.e., one-hot) encoding, following the process in Chapter 3. However, in practice, some care is needed to ensure that the categorical variables are transformed in a consistent way between the training and the test data."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"CL4uMwkXQgaP","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":236},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1653524449290,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":1708,"user":{"displayName":"Sophia Chung","userId":"18074224600171182532"}},"outputId":"5b415fec-6793-466d-a42a-74796c95a455"},"source":["import pandas as pd\n","df_housing = pd.read_csv(\"http://dlsun.github.io/pods/data/AmesHousing.txt\", sep=\"\\t\")\n","df_housing.head()"],"execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["   Order        PID  MS SubClass MS Zoning  Lot Frontage  Lot Area Street  \\\n","0      1  526301100           20        RL         141.0     31770   Pave   \n","1      2  526350040           20        RH          80.0     11622   Pave   \n","2      3  526351010           20        RL          81.0     14267   Pave   \n","3      4  526353030           20        RL          93.0     11160   Pave   \n","4      5  527105010           60        RL          74.0     13830   Pave   \n","\n","  Alley Lot Shape Land Contour  ...
