Since the labels are quantitative, all of the performance metrics are based on the difference between each predicted label $\\hat y$ and the true label $y$. \n","\n","One way to make sense of these differences is to square each difference and average the squared differences. This measure of error is known as _mean squared error_ (or _MSE_, for short):\n","\n","$$ \n","\\begin{align*}\n","\\textrm{MSE} &= \\textrm{mean of } (y - \\hat y)^2.\n","\\end{align*}\n","$$ \n","\n","MSE is difficult to interpret because its units are the square of the units of the label. To make MSE more interpretable, it is common to take the _square root_ of the MSE to obtain the _root mean squared error_ (or _RMSE_, for short):\n","\n","$$ \n","\\begin{align*}\n","\\textrm{RMSE} &= \\sqrt{\\textrm{MSE}}.\n","\\end{align*}\n","$$ \n","\n","The RMSE measures how off a \"typical\" prediction is. Notice that this reasoning is exactly the same reasoning that we used in Chapter 3 when we defined the standard deviation as the square root of the variance.\n","\n","Another common measure of error is the _mean absolute error_ (or _MAE_, for short):\n","\n","$$ \n","\\begin{align*}\n","\\textrm{MAE} &= \\textrm{mean of } |y - \\hat y|.\n","\\end{align*}\n","$$ \n","\n","Like the RMSE, the MAE measures how off a \"typical\" prediction is. \n","\n","MSE, RMSE, and MAE are all error metrics; we want them to be as small as possible. There are also performance metrics that we seek to maximize. One example is $R^2$, also known as the _coefficient of determination_:\n","\n","\\begin{align*}\n","R^2 &= 1 - \\frac{\\text{mean of } (y - \\hat y)^2}{\\text{mean of } (y - \\bar y)^2}.\n","\\end{align*}\n","\n","Notice that the denominator, $\\text{mean of } (y - \\bar y)^2$, is just the variance of the label $y$. So the interpretation of $\\frac{\\text{mean of } (y - \\hat y)^2}{\\text{mean of } (y - \\bar y)^2}$ is the fraction of the variance in the label $y$ that is \"left over\" after we fit the regression model. Therefore, $R^2$ can be interpreted as the fraction of variance that is explained by the regression model. It cannot be greater than $1.0$, but it can sometimes be negative if the regression model is worse than useless.\n","\n","These are just some of the performance metrics that are used to evaluate regression models.
